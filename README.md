# SMS Spam Filter using Supervised Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning-based spam classifier to detect whether a SMS is spam or ham (not spam). It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to analyze and classify email content.

## Project Overview

Spam messages are a common nuisance that can clutter inboxes and pose security risks. In this project, we:
- Preprocess raw email text data
- Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train a classification model (Multinomial Naive Bayes)
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## Dataset

The dataset contains labeled messages categorized as `spam` or `ham`.

>  **Dataset Source**: Spam-Ham Dataset on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bagavathypriya/spam-ham-dataset


## Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

This is about my simple project on classifying spam and ham mails from my inbox using naive bayes classification in Supervised machine learning Techniques.

Feel Free to drop your comments and your feedback here - [Email Me](mailto:yuvasree.t9@gmail.com) ( Hoping that it won't fill my inbox with spam messages :) )

Thanks for reading!!

To the dreams!!
Cheers!!!!
